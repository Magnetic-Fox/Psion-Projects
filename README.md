# Psion Projects

This is a simple repository containing my projects done in C++ for EPOC32 system (used mainly on Psion PDAs).

## What is included in this repo?

Some (currently one) really simple projects written in C++ using EPOC SDK.
For now, just one, simple console hello-world-like program, which isn't very useful.
